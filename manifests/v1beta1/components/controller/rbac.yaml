# We only need the verb create and not delete because all things are owned transitively by the
# experiment, so everything is cascade-deleted on experiment deletion.
# Early stopping currently creates a serviceaccount, role and rolebinding to manage trials and trails/status.
# The roles and rolebinding creation is the most important potential security issue now.
# Via new roles, rolebindings and pods in kubernetes system namespaces the cluster 
# could become compromised if katib-controller is compromised.
