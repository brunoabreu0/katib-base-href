## Name

Katib stands for `secretary` in Arabic. As `Vizier` stands for a high official or a prime minister in Arabic, this project Katib is named in the honor of Vizier.

## Concepts in Katib

Katib has the concepts of Experiment, Trial, Job and Suggestion.

### Experiment

`Experiment` represents a single optimization run over a feasible space.
Each `Experiment` contains a configuration describing the feasible space, as well as a set of Trials. 
It is assumed that objective function f(x) does not change in the course of a `Experiment`.

In v1alpha1, `Experiment` is defined as a CRD `StudyJob` in Kubernetes.
In v1alpha2, `Experiment` is defined as a CRD `Experiment`.

### Trial

A `Trial` is a list of parameter values, x, that will lead to a single evaluation of f(x). A Trial can be “Completed”, which means that it has been evaluated and the objective value f(x) has been assigned to it, otherwise it is “Pending”.

In v1alpha1, `Trial` is just a concept inside Katib and not exposed to users.
In v1alpha2, `Trial` is defined as a CRD `Trial` in Kubernetes.

### Job

A `Job` refers to a process responsible for evaluating a Pending `Trial` and calculating its objective value.

The job kind can be [Kubernetes Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/), [Kubeflow TFJob](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/guides/components/tftraining/) or [Kubeflow PyTorchJob](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/guides/components/pytorch/).
Thus Katib supports multiple frameworks with the help of different job kinds.

### Suggestion

A Suggestion is an algorithm to construct a parameter set according to the `Experiment`. Then `Trial` will be created to evaluate the parameter set.

Currently Katib supports the following exploration algorithms in v1alpha1:

* random search
* grid search
* [hyperband](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06560.pdf)
* [bayesian optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.2599.pdf)
* [NAS based on reinforcement learning](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/tree/master/pkg/suggestion/v1alpha1/NAS_Reinforcement_Learning)
* [NAS based on EnvelopeNets](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/tree/master/pkg/suggestion/v1alpha1/NAS_Envelopenet)

And Katib supports the following exploration algorithms in v1alpha2:

* random search

You can visualize general trend of Hyper parameter space and each training history. You can use
[random-example](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/examples/v1alpha1/random-example.yaml) or
[other examples](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/examples/v1alpha1) to generate a similar UI.

## API Documentation

Please refer to [api.md](./pkg/api/v1alpha1/gen-doc/api.md).

## Quickstart to run tfjob and pytorch operator jobs in Katib

For running tfjob and pytorch operator jobs in Katib, you have to install their packages.

In your Ksonnet app root, run the following

```
export KF_ENV=default
ks env set ${KF_ENV} --namespace=kubeflow
ks registry add kubeflow github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/master/kubeflow
```

### TFjob operator

For installing tfjob operator, run the following

```
ks pkg install kubeflow/tf-training
ks pkg install kubeflow/common
ks generate tf-job-operator tf-job-operator
ks apply ${KF_ENV} -c tf-job-operator
```

### Pytorch operator
For installing pytorch operator, run the following

```
ks pkg install kubeflow/pytorch-job
ks generate pytorch-operator pytorch-operator
ks apply ${KF_ENV} -c pytorch-operator
```

### Katib

Finally, you can install Katib

```
ks pkg install kubeflow/katib
ks generate katib katib
ks apply ${KF_ENV} -c katib
```

If you want to use Katib not in GKE and you don't have StorageClass for dynamic volume provisioning at your cluster, you have to create persistent volume to bound your persistent volume claim.

This is yaml file for persistent volume

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: katib-mysql
  labels:
    type: local
    app: katib
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /data/katib
```

Create this pv after deploying Katib package

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/manifests/v1alpha1/pv/pv.yaml
```

### Running examples

After deploy everything, you can run examples.

To run tfjob operator example, you have to install volume for it.

If you are using GKE and default StorageClass, you have to create this pvc

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: tfevent-volume
  namespace: kubeflow
  labels:
    type: local
    app: tfjob
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

If you are not using GKE and you don't have StorageClass for dynamic volume provisioning at your cluster, you have to create pvc and pv

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/examples/v1alpha1/tfevent-volume/tfevent-pvc.yaml

kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/examples/v1alpha1/tfevent-volume/tfevent-pv.yaml
```

This is example for tfjob operator

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/examples/v1alpha1/tfjob-example.yaml
```

This is example for pytorch operator

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/examples/v1alpha1/pytorchjob-example.yaml
```

You can check status of StudyJob

```yaml
$ kubectl describe studyjob pytorchjob-example -n kubeflow

When the spec.Status.Condition becomes ```Completed```, the StudyJob is finished.

You can monitor your results in Katib UI. For accessing to Katib UI, you have to install Ambassador.

In your Ksonnet app root, run the following

```
ks generate ambassador ambassador
ks apply ${KF_ENV} -c ambassador
```

After this, you have to port-forward Ambassador service

```
kubectl port-forward svc/ambassador -n kubeflow 8080:80
```

Finally, you can access to Katib UI using this URL: ```http://localhost:8080/katib/```.

### Cleanups

Delete installed components

```
ks delete ${KF_ENV} -c katib
ks delete ${KF_ENV} -c pytorch-operator
ks delete ${KF_ENV} -c tf-job-operator
```

If you create pv for Katib, delete it

```
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/manifests/v1alpha1/pv/pv.yaml
```

If you deploy Ambassador, delete it

```
ks delete ${KF_ENV} -c ambassador
```
